# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I use DataJoint with a GUI?

1. The DataJoint Works platform is set up as a fully managed service to host and execute data pipelines.

2. [LabBook](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-labbook) is an open source project
for data entry.

## Does DataJoint support other programming languages?

DataJoint [Python](https://datajoint.com/docs/core/datajoint-python/) and [Matlab]
(https://datajoint.com/docs/core/datajoint-matlab/) APIs are both actively supported.
Previous projects implemented some DataJoint features in
[Julia](https://github.com/BrainCOGS/neuronex_workshop_2018/tree/julia/julia) and
[Rust](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-core). DataJoint's data model and data
representation are largely language independent, which means that any language with a
DataJoint client can work with a data pipeline defined in any other language. DataJoint
clients for other programming languages will be implemented based on demand. All
languages must comply to the same data model and computation approach as defined in
[DataJoint: a simpler relational data model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11104).

## Can I use DataJoint with my current database?

Researchers use many different tools to keep records, from simple formalized file
heirarchies to complete software packages for colony management and standard file types
like NWB. Existing projects have built interfaces with many such tools, such as
[PyRAT](https://github.com/SFB1089/adamacs/blob/main/notebooks/03_pyrat_insert.ipynb).
The only requirement for interface is that tool has an open API. Contact
[Support@DataJoint.com](mailto:Support@DataJoint.com) with inquiries. The DataJoint
team will consider development requests based on community demand.

## Is DataJoint an ORM?

Programmers are familiar with object-relational mappings (ORM) in various programming
languages. Python in particular has several popular ORMs such as
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Django ORM](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_orm/).
The purpose of ORMs is to allow representations and manipulations of objects from the
host programming language as data in a relational database. ORMs allow making objects
persistent between program executions by creating a bridge (i.e., mapping) between the
object model used by the host language and the relational model allowed by the database.
The result is always a compromise, usually toward the object model. ORMs usually forgo
key concepts, features, and capabilities of the relational model for the sake of
convenient programming constructs in the language.

In contrast, DataJoint implements a data model that is a refinement of the relational
data model without compromising its core principles of data representation and queries.
DataJoint supports data integrity (entity integrity, referential integrity, and group
integrity) and provides a fully capable relational query language. DataJoint remains
absolutely data-centric, with the primary focus on the structure and integrity of the
data pipeline. Other ORMs are more application-centric, primarily focusing on the
application design while the database plays a secondary role supporting the application
with object persistence and sharing.

## What is the difference between DataJoint and Alyx?

[Alyx](https://github.com/cortex-lab/alyx) is an experiment management database
application developed in Kenneth Harris' lab at UCL.

Alyx is an application with a fixed pipeline design with a nice graphical user
interface. In contrast, DataJoint is a general-purpose library for designing and
building data processing pipelines.

Alyx is geared towards ease of data entry and tracking for a specific workflow
(e.g. mouse colony information and some pre-specified experiments) and data types.
DataJoint could be used as a more general purposes tool to design, implement, and
execute processing on such workflows/pipelines from scratch, and DataJoint focuses on
flexibility, data integrity, and ease of data analysis. The purposes are partly
overlapping and complementary. The
[International Brain Lab project](https://internationalbrainlab.com) is developing a
bridge from Alyx to DataJoint, hosted as an
[open-source project](https://github.com/datajoint-company/ibl-pipeline). It
implements a DataJoint schema that replicates the major features of the Alyx
application and a synchronization script from an existing Alyx database to its
DataJoint counterpart.
