# Operators

[Data queries](../query-objs) make use of operators to derive the desired table. They
represent the desired data symbolically, but do not contain any data. Once a query is
formed, we can [fetch](./common-commands#fetch) the data into the local workspace. Since
the expressions are only symbolic, repeated `fetch` calls may yield different results as
the state of the database is modified.

DataJoint implements a complete algebra of operators on tables:

| operator                     | notation       | meaning                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [join](#join)                | A * B          | All matching information from A and B                                   |
| [restriction](#restriction)  | A & cond       | The subset of entities from A that meet the condition                   |
| [restriction](#restriction)  | A - cond       | The subset of entities from A that do not meet the condition            |
| [proj](#proj)                | A.proj(...)    | Selects and renames attributes from A or computes new attributes        |
| [aggr](#aggr)                | A.aggr(B, ...) | Same as projection with computations based on matching information in B |
| [union](#union)              | A + B          | All unique entities from both A and B                                   |
| [universal set](#universal-set)\*| dj.U()     | All unique entities from both A and B                                   |

\*While not technically a query operator, it is useful to discuss Universal Set in the 
same context.

??? note "Notes on relational algebra" 

    DataJoint's algebra improves upon the classical
    relational algebra and upon other query languages to simplify and enhance the
    construction and interpretation of precise and efficient data queries.

    1.  **Entity integrity**: Data are represented and manipulated in the form of tables
    representing well-formed entity sets. This applies to the inputs and outputs of
    query operators. The output of a query operator is an entity set with a
    well-defined entity type, a primary key, unique attribute names, etc.

    2.  **Algebraic closure**: All operators operate on entity sets and yield entity
    sets. Thus query expressions may be used as operands in other expressions or may be
    assigned to variables to be used in other expressions.

    3.  **Attributes are identified by names**: All attributes have explicit names. This
    includes results of queries. Operators use attribute names to determine how to
    perform the operation. The order of the attributes is not significant.

These operators are based on the concept of **matching entities**. Two
entities **match** when they have no shared fields, or when their shared fields contain
the same values. Any shared fields should have compatible datatypes to allow equality
comparisons. Matching entities can be **merged** into a single entity without any
conflicts of attribute names and values.

In order for these operators to be applied to tables, they must also be 
<span id="join-compatible">**join-compatible**</span>, which means that:

1.  All fields in both tables must be part of either the 
[primary key](../concepts/glossary#primary-key) or a [foreign key](../concepts/glossary#foreign-key).

2.  All common fields must be of a compatible datatype for equality comparisons.

??? note "Why join compatibility restrictions?" 

    These restrictions are introduced both for performance reasons and for conceptual
    reasons. For performance, they encourage queries that rely on indexes. For
    conceptual reasons, they encourage database design in which entities in different
    tables are related to each other by the use of primary keys and foreign keys.

## Join

The Join operator `A * B` combines the matching information in `A` and `B`. The result
contains all matching combinations of entities from both arguments, including all
unique [primary keys](../concepts/glossary#primary-key) from both arguments. 

In the example below, we look at the union of (A) a table pairing sessions with users
and (B) a table pairing sessions with scan. 

<figure markdown>
![Join example](../images/concepts-operators-join1.png){: style="height:200px"}
</figure>

This has all the primary keys of both tables (a union thereof, shown in bold) as well as
all [secondary attributes](../concepts/glossary#seconday-attribute) (i.e., user and
duration). This also excludes the session for which we don't have a scan.

We can also join based on secondary attributes, as shown in the example below.

<figure markdown>
![Join example](../images/concepts-operators-join2.png){: style="height:200px"}
</figure>

??? notes "Additional join properties" 

    When the operands have no common attributes, the result is the cross product --
    all combinations of entities. In all cases, however ...

    1.  When `A` and `B` have the same attributes, the join `A * B` becomes equivalent to
    the set intersection `A` âˆ© `B`. Hence, DataJoint does not need a separate intersection
    operator.
    2.  Commutativity: `A * B` is equivalent to `B * A`.
    3.  Associativity: `(A * B) * C` is equivalent to `A * (B * C)`.

## Restriction

The restriction operator `A & cond` selects the subset of entities from `A` that meet
the condition `cond`. The exclusion operator `A - cond` selects the complement of
restriction, i.e. the subset of entities from `A` that do not meet the condition
`cond`. This means that the restriction and exclusion operators are complementary.
The same query could be constructed using either `A & cond` or `A - Not(cond)`.

<figure markdown>
![Restriction and exclusion.](../../../images/concepts-operators-restriction.png){: style="height:200px"}
</figure>

The condition `cond` may be one of the following:

=== "Python"

    -   another table
    -   a mapping, e.g. `dict`
    -   an expression in a character string
    -   a collection of conditions as a `list`, `tuple`, or Pandas `DataFrame`
    -   a Boolean expression (`True` or `False`)
    -   an `AndList`
    -   a `Not` object
    -   a query expression

??? Warning "Permissive Operators"

    To circumvent compatibility checks, DataJoint offers permissive operators for 
    Restriction (`^`) and Join (`@`). Use with Caution.

## Proj

The `proj` operator represents **projection** and is used to select attributes
(columns) from a table, to rename them, or to create new calculated attributes.

1. A simple projection *selects a subset of attributes* of the original
table, which may not include the [primary key](../concepts/glossary#primary-key).

2. A more complex projection *renames an attribute* in another table. This could be
useful when one table should be referenced multiple times in another. A user table,
could contain all personnel. A project table references one person for the lead and
another the coordinator, both referencing the common personnel pool.

3. Projection can also perform calculations (as available in 
[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/functions.html)) on a single attribute.

## Aggr

**Aggregation** is a special form of `proj` with the added feature of allowing
  aggregation calculations on another table. It has the form `table.aggr
  (other, ...)` where `other` is another table. Aggregation allows adding calculated
  attributes to each entity in `table` based on aggregation functions over attributes
  in the matching entities of `other`.

Aggregation functions include `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `avg`, `std`, `variance`,
and others.

## Union

The result of the union operator `A + B` contains all the entities from both operands. 

[Entity normalization](../design/normalization) requires that `A` and `B` are of the same type,
with with the same [primary key](../concepts/glossary#primary-key), using homologous
attributes. Without secondary attributes, the result is the simple set union. With
secondary attributes, they must have the same names and datatypes. The two operands
must also be **disjoint**, without any duplicate primary key values across both inputs.
These requirements prevent ambiguity of attribute values and preserve entity identity.

??? Note "Principles of union"

    1.  As in all operators, the order of the attributes in the operands is not
    significant.

    2.  Operands `A` and `B` must have the same primary key attributes. Otherwise, an
    error will be raised.

    3.  Operands `A` and `B` may not have any common non-key attributes. Otherwise, an
    error will be raised.

    4.  The result `A + B` will have the same primary key as `A` and `B`.

    5.  The result `A + B` will have all the non-key attributes from both `A` and `B`.

    6.  For entities that are found in both `A` and `B` (based on the primary key), the
    secondary attributes will be filled from the corresponding entities in `A` and
    `B`.

    7.  For entities that are only found in either `A` or `B`, the other operand's
    secondary attributes will filled with null values.

For union, order does not matter.

<figure markdown>
![Union Example 2](../../../images/concepts-operators-union2.png){: style="height:200px"}
</figure>

??? Note "Properties of union"

    1.  Commutative: `A + B` is equivalent to `B + A`.
    2.  Associative: `(A + B) + C` is equivalent to `A + (B + C)`.

## Universal Set

All of the above operators are designed to preserve their input type. Some queries may
require creating a new entity type not already represented by existing tables. This
means that the new type must be defined as part of the query. 

Universal sets fulfill this role using `dj.U` notation. They denote the set of all
possible entities with given attributes of any possible datatype. Attributes of
universal sets are allowed to be matched to any namesake attributes, even those that do
not come from the same initial source.

Universal sets should be used sparingly when no suitable base tables already exist. In
some cases, defining a new base table can make queries clearer and more semantically
constrained.

The examples below will use the table definitions in [table tiers](../reproduce/table-tiers).

<!-- ## Join appears here in the general docs -->

## Restriction

`&` and `-` operators permit restriction.

### By a mapping

For a [Session table](../reproduce/table-tiers#manual-tables), that has the attribute
`session_date`, we can restrict to sessions from January 1st, 2022:

```python
Session & {'session_date': "2022-01-01"}
```

If there were any typos (e.g., using `sess_date` instead of `session_date`), our query
will return all of the entities of `Session`.

### By a string

Conditions may include arithmetic operations, functions, range tests, etc. Restriction
of table `A` by a string containing an attribute not found in table `A` produces an
error.

```python
Session & 'user = "Alice"' # (1)
Session & 'session_date >= "2022-01-01"' # (2)
```

1. All the sessions performed by Alice
2. All of the sessions on or after January 1st, 2022

### By a collection

When `cond` is a collection of conditions, the conditions are applied by logical
disjunction (logical OR). Restricting a table by a collection will return all entities
that meet *any* of the conditions in the collection. 

For example, if we restrict the `Session` table by a collection containing two
conditions, one for user and one for date, the query will return any sessions with a
matching user *or* date.

A collection can be a list, a tuple, or a Pandas `DataFrame`.

``` python
cond_list = ['user = "Alice"', 'session_date = "2022-01-01"'] # (1)
cond_tuple = ('user = "Alice"', 'session_date = "2022-01-01"') # (2)
import pandas as pd
cond_frame = pd.DataFrame(data={'user': ['Alice'], 'session_date': ['2022-01-01']}) # (3)

Session() & ['user = "Alice"', 'session_date = "2022-01-01"']
```

1. A list
2. A tuple
3. A data frame

`dj.AndList` represents logical conjunction(logical AND). Restricting a table by an
`AndList` will return all entities that meet *all* of the conditions in the list. `A &
dj.AndList([c1, c2, c3])` is equivalent to `A & c1 & c2 & c3`.

```python
Student() & dj.AndList(['user = "Alice"', 'session_date = "2022-01-01"'])
```

The above will show all the sessions that Alice conducted on the given day.

### By a `Not` object

The special function `dj.Not` represents logical negation, such that `A & dj.Not
(cond)` is equivalent to `A - cond`.

### By a query

Restriction by a query object is a generalization of restriction by a table. The example
below creates a query object corresponding to all the users named Alice. The `Session`
table is then restricted by the query object, returning all the sessions performed by
Alice.

``` python
query = User & 'user = "Alice"'
Session & query
```

## Proj

Renaming an attribute in python can be done via keyword arguments: 

```python
table.proj(new_attr='old_attr')
```

This can be done in the context of a table definition:

```python
@schema
class Session(dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    # Experiment Session
    -> Animal
    session             : smallint  # session number for the animal
    ---
    session_datetime    : datetime  # YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    session_start_time  : float     # seconds relative to session_datetime
    session_end_time    : float     # seconds relative to session_datetime
    -> User.proj(experimenter='username')
    -> User.proj(supervisor='username')
    """
```

Or to rename multiple values in a table with the following syntax: 
`Table.proj(*existing_attributes,*renamed_attributes)`

```python
Session.proj('session','session_date',start='session_start_time',end='session_end_time')
```

Projection can also be used to to compute new attributes from existing ones.

```python
Session.proj(duration='session_end_time-session_start_time') & 'duration > 10'
```

## Aggr

For more complicated calculations, we can use aggregation.

``` python
Subject.aggr(Session,n="count(*)") # (1)
Subject.aggr(Session,average_start="avg(session_start_time)") # (2)
```

1. Number of sessions per subject.
2. Average `session_start_time` for each subject

<!-- ## Union appears here in the general docs -->

## Universal set

Universal sets offer the complete list of combinations of attributes.

``` python
# All home cities of students
dj.U('laser_wavelength', 'laser_power') & Scan # (1)
dj.U('laser_wavelength', 'laser_power').aggr(Scan, n="count(*)") # (2)
dj.U().aggr(Session, n="max(session)") # (3)
```

1. All combinations of wavelength and power.
2. Total number of scans for each combination.
3. Largest session number.

`dj.U()`, as shown in the last example above, is often useful for integer IDs.
