# Filepath Datatype

Note: Filepath Datatype is available as a preview feature in DataJoint Python v0.12. 
This means that the feature is required to be explicitly enabled. To do so, make sure 
to set the environment variable `FILEPATH_FEATURE_SWITCH=TRUE` prior to use.

## Configuration & Usage

Corresponding to issue 
[#481](https://github.com/datajoint/datajoint-python/issues/481), 
the `filepath` attribute type links DataJoint records to files already
managed outside of DataJoint. This can aid in sharing data with
other systems such as allowing an image viewer application to
directly use files from a DataJoint pipeline, or to allow downstream
tables to reference data which reside outside of DataJoint
pipelines.

To define a table using the `filepath` datatype, an existing DataJoint
[store](../../sysadmin/external-store.md) should be created and then referenced in the 
new table definition. For example, given a simple store:

```python
  dj.config['stores'] = {
    'data': {
      'protocol': 'file',
      'location': '/data',
      'stage': '/data'
    }
  }
```

we can define an `ScanImages` table as follows:

```python
@schema
class ScanImages(dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    -> Session
    image_id:    int
    ---
    image_path:  filepath@data 
    """
```

This table can now be used for tracking paths within the `/data` local directory.
For example:

```python
>>> ScanImages.insert1((0, 0, '/data/images/image_0.tif'))
>>> (ScanImages() & {'session_id': 0}).fetch1(as_dict=True)
{'session_id': 0, 'image_id': 0, 'image_path': '/data/images/image_0.tif'}
```

As can be seen from the example, unlike [blob](blobs.md) records, file
paths are managed as path locations to the underlying file.

## Integrity Notes

Unlike other data in DataJoint, data in `filepath` records are
deliberately intended for shared use outside of DataJoint.  To help
ensure integrity of `filepath` records, DataJoint will record a
checksum of the file data on `insert`, and will verify this checksum
on `fetch`. However, since the underlying file data may be shared
with other applications, special care should be taken to ensure
records stored in `filepath` attributes are not modified outside
of the pipeline, or, if they are, that records in the pipeline are
updated accordingly. A safe method of changing `filepath` data is
as follows:

  1. Delete the `filepath` database record.
     This will ensure that any downstream records in the pipeline depending
     on the `filepath` record are purged from the database.
  2. Modify `filepath` data.
  3. Re-insert corresponding the `filepath` record.
     This will add the record back to DataJoint with an updated file checksum.
  4. Compute any downstream dependencies, if needed.
     This will ensure that downstream results dependent on the `filepath`
     record are updated to reflect the newer `filepath` contents.

### Disable Fetch Verification

Note: Skipping the checksum is not recommended as it ensures file integrity i.e. 
downloaded files are not corrupted. With S3 stores, most of the time to complete a 
`.fetch()` is from the file download itself as opposed to evaluating the checksum. This 
option will primarily benefit `filepath` usage connected to a local `file` store.

To disable checksums you can set a threshold in bytes
for when to stop evaluating checksums like in the example below:

```python
dj.config["filepath_checksum_size_limit"] = 5 * 1024**3 # Skip for all files greater than 5GiB
```

The default is `None` which means it will always verify checksums.
