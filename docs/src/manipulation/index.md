# Data Manipulation

Data **manipulation** operations change the state of the data stored in the database 
without modifying the structure of the stored data.
These operations include [insert](insert.md), [delete](delete.md), and 
[update](update.md).

Data manipulation operations in DataJoint respect the 
[integrity](../design/integrity.md) constraints.
