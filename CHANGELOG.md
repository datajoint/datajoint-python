### 0.3.6  -- July 30, 2016
* bugfix in `schema.spawn_missing_classes`.  Previously, spawned part classes would not show in ERDs.

* ERD() no longer text the context argument.
* ERD.draw() now takes an optional context argument.  By default uses the caller's locals.

### 0.3.2.   
* Fixed issue #223:  `insert` can insert relations without fetching.
* ERD() now takes the `context` argument, which specifies in which context to look for classes. The default is taken from the argument (schema or relation).
* ERD.draw() no longer has the `prefix` argument: class names are shown as found in the context.
