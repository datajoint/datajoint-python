## Integration Test Results - FINAL

**Test Summary:**
- ✅ 520 tests PASSED
- ⏭️  7 tests SKIPPED
- ❌ 0 tests FAILED

**All tests passing!**

### Initial Issues Found and Fixed

Initial run had 24 failures in object storage tests due to test fixture bug:
- `conftest.py`: object_storage_config wasn't creating the `test_project` subdirectory
- `test_update1.py`: mock_stores_update wasn't creating `djtest` subdirectories

**Root cause:** Test fixtures were configuring storage locations but not creating
the directories. StorageBackend validates that file protocol locations exist
during initialization.

**Fix:** Added `Path(location).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` in both fixtures.

### Test Coverage Verified

All unified stores configuration functionality tested:
- ✅ Configuration system with stores.default and stores.filepath_default
- ✅ Prefix validation and separation (hash_prefix, schema_prefix, filepath_prefix)
- ✅ Filepath codec validation with dynamic prefix checking
- ✅ Store backend initialization and validation
- ✅ Object storage (file, stream, folder operations)
- ✅ Hash-addressed storage (blob, attach)
- ✅ Schema-addressed storage (object, npy)
- ✅ All relational operators and queries
- ✅ Schema management and dependencies
